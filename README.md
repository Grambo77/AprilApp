# 🌸 AprilApp

**AprilApp** is a passion-project PWA built as a creative playground and love letter for my wife, April.  
It blends music fandom, interactive visuals, and playful features into a lightweight, installable web app.

The app is intentionally fun, expressive, and experimental — and anyone is welcome to use it or suggest ideas.
